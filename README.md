# NFT Coldswap 
A set of new contracts designed to work alongside [NFT Hotswap v2](https://github.com/Peng-Protocol/NFT-Coldswap/tree/bbcfe86e99369da1df37824fd6d21f1ae361e36b/NFT%20Hotswap%20v2). Based on the original [NFT Hotswap](https://github.com/Peng-Protocol/NFT-Hotswap/tree/main).

## Routers 
Hotswap Routers are meant to work alongside existing CFAMM DEXs (Constant Function Automated Market Maker Decentralized Exchanges) such as QuickSwap in order to enable swapping to and from any token the user desires in exchange for or from a listed NFT, this enables swapping to or from the native blockchain token as well. 

## Coldswap Contracts
The Coldswap contracts allow fractionalizing an NFT collection into a fungible token created by Coldswap, the NFT items can then be exchanged - at a ratio set by the deployer - with the Cold Tokens. Cold tokens can have any name and supply the deployer wants. 

Coldswap also has a marketplace for listing specific NFT items at bid/ask price, thereby allowing more speculation.
